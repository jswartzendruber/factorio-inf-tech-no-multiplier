# No Science Cost Multiplier on Infinite Technologies

This is a tiny factorio mod that turns off the science multiplier for infinite technologies.

If you have a 10x science cost multiplier set, mining productivity 1 will cost 25k science, 2 will cost 50k, and 3 will start at 1k and then scale normally from there.
